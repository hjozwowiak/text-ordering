#### Web application for creating SEO guidelines for Copywriters

## Inspiration

The purpose of this application is to simplify and automate a process of generating documents provided to Copywriters which have to be entirely consistent with an established template.

The idea of creating this app came up after hours of copying and modyfying repeatable parts of a mentioned template and a tremendous frustration which it led to.

This app saves hours of work and reduces a chance of making mistakes due to its clean and simple design.

## Usage

An app provides a set of inputs which transform given data into a formatted text ready to use in a text order.

All you have to do is to fill inputs labeled as data that you want to provide to a Copywriter.
